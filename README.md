## Full-stack developer at **Devlights**

My interests as a software dev are:
- Progress towards bolder and cleaner coding practices
- Help my team and learn all I can from my colleagues
- Improve my communication skills to enhance information exchange between the dev teams and other less technical-related departments
- Deliver value to the client and clarity about the processes involved in building quality software
- Create meaningful relations with the people involved in the projects I work
