# Hi there! 👋

### *I'm Tomas, from Cordoba - Argentina* ⚪🔵

I'm a self-taught developer, interested in all related to **web development**. 

*Javascript* and *Node* are my main languajes but I'm currently diving into *Java* to strengthen my back-end OOP skills 🐱‍🏍

### Besides programming I love:

- ⛰ treking 

- 🏀 playing basketball

- 🎸 playing guitar and sing (in fact I'm an actual guitar teacher)

- 🍻 and of course hanging with friends whenever possible!!
