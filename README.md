## I'm a self-taught developer from Cordoba (Argentina), interested in all related to **web development**. 
The stack I feel more confident working with is React (Router, Axios, Redux), MongoDB (Mongoose), MySQL (Prisma, Sequelize), Node (Express), GraphQL (Apollo), Jest and Cypress.

My interest as a self-taught developer is to constantly progress towards bolder and cleaner coding practices; help others whenever possible and learn all I can from more experienced developers.
