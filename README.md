Things I care about:
- Leaning toward bolder/cleaner coding practices
- Choosing the right tools for the right problems
- Improving performance and tracking application bottlenecks
- Delivering clarity about the processes involved in building quality software to management departments 
- Creating meaningful relations with the people I work with
